# Ocean-Dynamics
This MATLAB code simulates the dynamics of shallow water using a numerical model. It solves the shallow water equations iteratively over time, incorporating various physical parameters and phenomena such as gravitational forces, Coriolis effects, and source terms.

# Features
- Simulation of shallow water dynamics over a defined domain.
- Incorporation of gravitational forces, Coriolis effects, and bottom friction.
- Specification of source terms to model water sources or sinks.
- Visualization of layer height and velocity components throughout the simulation.

# Requirements
- MATLAB environment (R2016b or later recommended).

# Usage
1) Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
2) Open the MATLAB environment.
3) Open the provided MATLAB script file (shallow_water_simulation.m).
4) Run the script to execute the simulation.
5) The script will generate visualizations of layer height and velocity components during the simulation.

# Customization
- Users can customize simulation parameters such as domain size, water depth, source strength, and time step factor within the script.
- Visualization settings can be modified to suit specific requirements.

# Notes
- The code uses finite-difference methods to solve the shallow water equations numerically.
- Stability and accuracy of the simulation may vary based on parameter settings and grid resolution.
